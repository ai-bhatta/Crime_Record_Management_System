# CRIME RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Hey ya!
 I've been obsessed with crime thrillers from a long time now, so what else could've been better than making a crime record management system??ðŸ˜¸
 
ðŸ¤“**About this project**

-This is a crime record management system made using python and MySQL. 

-The libraries I've used to develop include-pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn rtc.

-Used Sql connector to load details of criminals from the database. The projectâ€™s interface is very user-friendly and helpful for authority, it has an option to work in offline mode as well.
